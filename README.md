# Crowd-Backend Coding challenge
Welcome to the backend coding contest. You will be divided into teams and then you have one hour to collect as many points as possible during that time.

# How to
In the problems folder you will find a text doc / word doc with the task description. For most of the tasks there will be an attached input file which contains the input to the problem. In some cases the input is written in the text file (Task 1 & 4).

# Submitting
The answers will be submitted to me Andre Scheir Johansson via slack or teams. I want the answer in the form of: T(X)P(X) = <ANSWER> where T is the task number and P is part 1 or part 2. So for task 3 part 2 and you want to guess for 1337, send me T3P2 = 1337. You will get an immediate response if the answer is correct or not.
 
# GOOD LUCK :)
